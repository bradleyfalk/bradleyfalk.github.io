        Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I am a serial entrepreneur with over 20 years in software engineering and
        ten years of experience with growing startups. I am ambitious, hard working with a passion
        for learning and continuous improvement. I get my energy in solving complex problems with
        technology that increase productivity and revenue while working across multiple teams, and
        having ownership and agency. I love building products that people use and love, especially
        developer tools. Finally, I love inspiring and mentoring other engineers in their careers.
        I believe my experiences at Summon, Tally and more will take you to the next level. I have
        raised funding for two startups, I have hired teams across several disciplines including web,
        product, data and cloud engineering and brought products to market.
    </p>
    <div class="h2" id="goals">Goals</div>
    <div>
        My goal is to leverage my technical experience and make an impact by thinking big,
        executing on a vision to build better solutions, and pushing the boundaries of systems using modern
        technologies. I'm about being an implementor in backend systems, and not front end and not managing
        people as my primary responsibility. I want to push into larger and later stage companies bringing
        my startup energy to larger scale problems with measurable results. Finally, I want to work with
        diverse and empathetic leaders to be a better human being.

    <p>
        I bring vast experience as I've seen the cycles of the industry over the past decades. In early stage
        companies, I have to wear many hats but, I still have to build the initial product. As the company grows, I
        continuously bring value by helping motivated engineers and teams grow by pushing autonomy whiel maintaining
        velocity and increasing quality, security and complexity needs.
        I am a proficient engineer, confident in the languages I know and picking up new ones along the way.
        I can jump between front end code, back end code, build pipelines and infrastructure. Usually I find it's
        more productive to actively remove active or potential roadblocks from teams, so they can focus on building
        products and I can build features, so they can support the product.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, I enjoy building pipelines that bring code to production as fast as possible. I've particularly
        enjoyed working with Kubernetes and Cloud services to solve these problems. Lately Iâ€™ve been working with
        Graph and Vector databases and AutoGPT product experiments. I thrive in changing and challenging environments.
    </p>
    <div class="h2" id="leadership">Company Leadership</div>
    <p>
        As my experience grows, so does my passion, and it's my belief that we can inspire and grow
        up-and-coming talent to make a positive impact. I've led both small and large teams - of
        up to 30 people (15 direct reports), dividing and conquering the problems we were tackling.
        I have been responsible for introducing a recruiting process for different roles at different
        companies. I have created incident management, product support processes, engineering leveling,
        career matrix and growth plans, new employee onboarding plans / experience and security policies.
        I've had to balance just enough process to support engineering productivity with company
        requirements while not being too onerous.

                <p>
                    After Tally, the co-founder of Tally and I discovered a shared passion for product development,
                    blending design and engineering. We joined to create a new company to build a new product in
                    this space. I was responsible for building two distinct products: Strings and Summon.
                    Strings was a copy writing tool that made it easy for writers to edit copy, the text, in web
                    and mobile apps. I was responsible for all product services and infrastructure while I hired
                    a contractor on the front end. This product lasted only 18 months, however, as there was too
                    much friction in giving access to application source code to our tool for the writers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our other product, Summon had a much larger vision as an integrated developer experience space
                    for developers to improve their developer lifecycle. I believe that there are so many disjoint
                    tools that compete for attention and increasing cognitive load. These tools include tools for
                    project management, documentation, version control, pipelines, infrastructure, observability,
                    etc. Finding the right thing at the right time is becoming counter-productive. Summon
                    aimed to bring the right data to your fingertips without switching between all your browser
                    tabs. By building a graph of your work, you could maximize signal-to-noise. I'm passionate
                    about the developer productivity space but ultimately it was too large of a product to build
                    as venture capital dries up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time with Recursive Rebels, my responsibilities and accomplishments include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Strings was a product I built ground up. I chose Golang for its simplicity and performance
                        relative to Scala, which I chose for Tally. As a bootstrapped project, I built without a
                        team a microservices platform fully managed using Terraform on Google Cloud, using GKE.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For strings, built and maintained services for identity management, projects,
                        resource services to parse and replace copy in json, xml, and plist files. Also,
                        services for notifications, version control to push and read changes in source code,
                        and teams for team and profile management. It turned into a large project and
                        became clear I would need a team to take it to the next level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Summon was a product I built ground up help of a small team to start. I chose to keep
                        using Golang as it was very successful for Strings and was easier to hire for.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Built a library to improve our workflow in using DGraph DQL access
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Built a library for event streams, a pattern for asynchronous data processing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a recruiting process that shared ownership with the team and grew a fully remote,
                        international team across North and South America,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating and evangelizing a product and technical vision for the team,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fostering autonomous teams by letting them self select for their strengths and encourage
                        growth to fill the gaps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A continuous deployment pipeline that reduced the time from commit to production to under 15
                        minutes for all services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a process to respond to infrastructure and product incidents by actively promoting
                        12-factor app as our definition of Done resulting in only one production outage and a mean
                        time to resolution of 30 minutes and mean time to acknowledge of 5 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using Terraform to manage all infrastructure using GitOps and supporting a secured cloud
                        environment for engineers and allowing team to add additional infrastructure and services
                        automatically deployed to Kubernetes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a security policy and managing access to services while still having ability to support
                        their own services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating an Agent pattern for new services to be created that can read and write from APIs from
                        new vendors, such as Slack, Confluence, Google Docs, etc. This resulted in a dramatic
                        productivity boost for the team when creating new agent.
                    </li>

                    In the second phase of my time at Tally, having hired a more experienced engineering manager,
                    I transitioned to a Staff Engineer focusing on internal tooling and developer platforms. I was
                    given the opportunity to continue management, but chose to focus on engineering as I could
                    have a greater impact. My final accomplishments include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Introduce an Incident Support process, including a categorization strategy to prioritize
                        incidents such as security, defects and outages, also to roll out PagerDuty and an on-call
                        schedule across all engineering. The process included automation allowing teams to measure
                        and apply their SLIs and SLOs.

                    <li>
                        Built a small web application to allow potential customers to test if they qualify and
                        download the Tally app on their mobile device. It was an upstream sales funnel pilot project
                        that increased customer acquisition by a small percentage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Built an internal tool for the customer support, credit teams and others to manage the
                        platform and our customers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When our User Management system was no longer appropriate, I transitioned us to AWS Cognito
                        to improve the security of managing user identity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transitioned code versioning from BitBucket to self-hosted GitLab for all teams, and
                        migrated build processes from Jenkins to GitLab's CI/CD to provide fine-grained deployment
                        capabilities and visibility to versions of services in Kubernetes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This was a personal transition for me as I needed to step back from the leadership side.
                    I wanted to spend more time on the engineering side and I recognize that I have more to learn
                    in managing people and what a rapidly growing company needs for the teams.

                    Tally helps you save money by automatically paying down your credit card with a revolving line of
                    credit. I was the first hire at Tally and was Head of Engineering. I was responsible for building
                    our MVP which was effectively a bank. I built the stack in Scala with integrations for credit
                    reporting data, credit card information and services for ledgers and payment generation and user
                    management. I was also responsible for hiring a team and establishing the process to e the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this time, I accomplished the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Created a recruiting process which resulted in the hiring of over 30 engineers. The process
                        was seen as highly engaging and entertaining by candidates and by the team. The process
                        evolved as we collected additional data points but scaled to hiring an international team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Built a stack focused on stability and quality for Financial Services. The Scala stack
                        supported growth to 1000s of users and significant annual revenue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I oversaw the development of the initial iOS app, and the subsequent Android app
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I hired our Head of Data Engineering and Head of Product Engineering and established a
                        Q/A team and a cloud services (infrastructure) team.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I feel I grew a lot during this time. It was extremely stressful yet incredibly rewarding
                    seeing how successful the company is now. The experience gave me new skills that I applied
                    when building Summon, from which the co-founder from Tally and I ultimately teamed up to
                    build Summon.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I was brought in as a Sr Java Engineer who initially worked with an existing Java application
                    build on GWT, Spring 2.0 and Postgres but pushed through an effort to improve the platform for
                    performance, scalability and to improve the user experience
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built a proof-of-concept application that leveraged modern technologies that demonstrated
                    a decoupled application architecture that dramatically improved developer turnaround time,
                    reduced application complexity and a modern user interface The result was renewed respect
                    for the technology group and allowed us to build a new platform product group and a new
                    exciting way to build the business

                <p>
                    I was then responsible for building a platform team where we built eight applications to
                    provide services to the web team. I developed an architecture that built on our best
                    developers strengths while leveraging the modern (at the time) web-centric tools such as
                    SOLR for search, MongoDB for documented oriented structured data.

                <p>
                    In the span of six months, my team built the back-end service infrastructure that supported
                    a 50,000 user base at its peak.

                    SecondMarket represented a change in my career development as it was my first foray into the
                    Financial industry and was my first position with a non-consulting company. I had found the
                    experience deeply rewarding and gave me the passion to build a new company.
